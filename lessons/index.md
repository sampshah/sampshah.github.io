## Some lessons, realizations, and thoughts

### Lessons

**Lesson 1:**  
Brilliance is to know when to stop.  

**Lesson 2:**  
You shall never regret the time you spent on yourself.

**Lesson 3:**  
There will always come situations when there will be no "deterministically best" choice that you can make given the options. None will seem the best, all of them will have their pros and cons, and you wouldn't be able to weigh them. *TODO:* Do not waste time thinking too much on the options once you know the pros and cons. Wise is the one who makes the choice which seems good and works hard to make it the best. Time is of utmost importance, don't spend time thinking, spend time doing.

### Thoughts
**Thought 1:**  
We are tiny humans, so sensitive to tiniest things like viruses; who barely survive for a 100 years in the universe which has been here since billions of those; only within a 100 degree range, on the scale which knows no bounds; too tiny to brag about a few kgs, a few curves, a few leisures, a few assets, all of which shall turn into ashes one day. Try to focus on what remains with us on the deathbed, the memories, the experiences we had, and the people we met. Be grateful, be humble, keep it simple.
