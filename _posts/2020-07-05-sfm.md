title: Structure From Motion | Tech
comments: true

This is the first Tech blog on the website, many more to come. These blogs will be about something I find interesting from Engineering perspective, or some concepts I find myself revisiting often and I feel the need to keep them in an easily accessible place.  

Starting with one of the most important concepts from Classical Computer Vision, structure from motion. There ideally aren't many resources that explain it well, so here is my take on explaining it. I was introduced to it from Prof. Kostas's class on Perception at Penn, and I shall be using his illustrations.  

Prerequisite:  
- Basic Computer Vision/ Camera geometry knowledge is a must  
- Knowledge of Linear Algebra (Eigen vectors, Null spaces)  
- Knowledge of Transformations
