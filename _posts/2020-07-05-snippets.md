## Python general


- Error catching  
Python

``` 
assert <expression> , "<message>"

# OR

if not <expression>:
    raise AssertionError("<message>")

    # some exception types that can be used:
    # AssertionError, IndexError, RunTimeError, TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionErrore

# OR use try except

try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong") # if error in try
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")  # if no error in try

# try except with finally

try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")  # finally block is executed regardless of errors or no errors in try
```

## Linux and Git Commands  

- Sometimes you may want to keep a watch on something:  
```
watch -n <number_of_seconds> <command>
```

- Reduce brightness below minimum  (replace 2070)
```
cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
sudo su -c "echo 2070 >/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
```

- Mute an application :   
```
pacmd list-sink-inputs
pacmd set-sink-input-mute <index> true(/false)
```

- Setting upstream: sometimes you may want a local branch to track another remote branch
```
# check which branch tracks what
git branch -vv
# set upstream
git branch -u <remote>/<branch>
# or If you just wish to push once to another remote branch 
git push <remote> <local_branch>:<remote_name>
```

- sshfs: One of the most handy commands when working on remote server  
```
sshfs USER@IP:/$PATH $LOCAL_PATH
```

- scp: copy recursively all files and folders  
```
scp -rp sourcedirectory user@dest:/path
# -r for recursive and -p to preserve modification times and modes
```

- Screen: another handy function when working remotely, to prevent creating multiple sessions locally
```
# make screen
screen -S myscreen 
# list all 
screen -ls
# attach to a session
screen -r <name>
# detach
screen -d <name>
# detach
C-a d
# kill
C-a k
```

## Miscellaneous  

- Auto reload modules in Jupyter  
```
# add to beginning of notebook
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

- Run Jupyter Nodebook on remote server via ssh  
``` 
# open it on remote
sasha@remote $ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8887

# Tunnel through ssh on local
ssh -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8887 sasha@remote
```
