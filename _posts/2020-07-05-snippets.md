# Competitive Coding 

## Sorting Algorithms  

- Bubble sort  
C++

 ```cpp
void bubble_sort( int A[ ], int n ) {
    int temp;
    for(int k = 0; k< n-1; k++) {
        // (n-k-1) is for ignoring comparisons of elements which have already been compared in earlier iterations

        for(int i = 0; i < n-k-1; i++) {
            if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1] ) {
                // here swapping of positions is being done.
                temp = A[ i ];
                A[ i ] = A[ i+1 ];
                A[ i + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```  

Python: 

 ```python
def bubbleSort(arr): 
    n = len(arr) 
  
    # Traverse through all array elements 
    for i in range(n-1): 
    # range(n) also work but outer loop will repeat one time more than needed. 
  
        # Last i elements are already in place 
        for j in range(0, n-i-1): 
  
            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1 
            # Swap if the element found is greater 
            # than the next element 
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] : 
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j] 

 ```


... to be continued


- Insertion sort  
C++

```cpp
void insertion_sort(int A[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        /*storing current element whose left side is checked for its 
                 correct position .*/

        int temp = A[i];
        int j = i;

        /* check whether the adjacent element in left side is greater or
             less than the current element. */

        while (j > 0 && temp < A[j - 1]) {

            // moving the left side element to one position forward.
            A[j] = A[j - 1];
            j = j - 1;

        }
        // moving current element to its  correct position.
        A[j] = temp;
    }
}

```
Python

```python
def insertionSort(arr): 
  
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr) 
    for i in range(1, len(arr)): 
  
        key = arr[i] 
  
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
        # greater than key, to one position ahead 
        # of their current position 
        j = i-1
        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] : 
                arr[j+1] = arr[j] 
                j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key 
```
