- [Sizes of Classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-is-the-size-of-an-empty-class-not-zero-in-c/)
- [Templates](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/templates#templates-defn-vs-decl) (Specifically for syntax and definition in cpp file FAQ)
- When having a member of the Class type, remember [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-a-c-class-have-an-object-of-self-type/)
- Using [const](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15999123/const-before-parameter-vs-const-after-function-name-c):  
```cpp
struct X
{
    void foo() const // <== The implicit "this" pointer is const-qualified!
    {
        _x = 42; // ERROR! The "this" pointer is implicitly const
        _y = 42; // OK (_y is mutable)
    }

    void bar(X& obj) const // <== The implicit "this" pointer is const-qualified!
    {
        obj._x = 42; // OK! obj is a reference to non-const
        _x = 42; // ERROR! The "this" pointer is implicitly const
    }

    void bar(X const& obj) // <== The implicit "this" pointer is NOT const-qualified!
    {
        obj._x = 42; // ERROR! obj is a reference to const
        obj._y = 42; // OK! obj is a reference to const, but _y is mutable
        _x = 42; // OK! The "this" pointer is implicitly non-const
    }

    int _x;
    mutable int _y;
};
```
