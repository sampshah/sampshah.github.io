Hey there, welcome to my website! I am Saumya Shah. 

I am currently pursuing Master's in Robotics at [University of Pennylania](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I graduated from [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/) in 2019 with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (Honors), along with a minor in Electronics and Communications Engineering. 

Due to interdisciplinary nature of Robotics, I have a very diverse background. I believe in Robotics and the positive impact of robotics in the long term. I love to discuss ideas, try new things, fail and yet keep chasing the goals. Let's talk about anything and everything that requires thinking unconventionally!  

Here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0S0bOpat6SzQO6fNgfLv2fHgMha-_Aw/view?usp=sharing). 

You can find me at the following places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email.
