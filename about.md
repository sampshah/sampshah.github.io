Hey there, welcome to my website! I am Saumya Shah.

I am currently pursuing Master's in Robotics at [University of Pennylania](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I graduated from [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/) in 2019 with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (Honors), along with a minor in Electronics and Communications Engineering. 

You can find me at the following places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email.
