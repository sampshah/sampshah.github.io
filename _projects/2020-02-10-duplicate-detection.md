title: "Duplicate detection using LSH"
description: "Given a 150,000+ Amazon review dataset, the project aims to find all the similar review pairs and also all the similar reviews given a query text for some measure of similarity. Jaccard distance similarity metric was used. The k-shingle representation was used and min-hashing was performed as a locally sensitive hasing mechanism for faster processing. Comination of min-hashes were used to filter the search at the given similarity cutoff."
