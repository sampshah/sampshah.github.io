title: "Image morphing"
description: "This project aims at morphing a given pair of images along with the corresponding feature correspondences. Delaunay triangulation is performed over the given pairs of images with the corresponding points as vertices. The geometry of the triangles is morphed by performing intermediate affine transformations and a sequence of morphs are generated."
