title: "CNC machine development and redesigning double parallelogram"
description: "CNC controller was designed for the micro-milling machine used for manufacturing of base plates for the Hele-Shaw cell experiments. UGS was used to generate the g-codes and GRBL was used for the control using the g-codes passed to actuate stepper motors using Raspberry Pi microcontroller. Capacitive filter and the PCB were also designed for robustness to the switching noise of the stepper motor. The latter part of the internship was focussed on development of double parallelogram mechanism using sheet-metal bending for large scale fabrication."
