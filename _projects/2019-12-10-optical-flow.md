title: "Optical Flow for bounding box tracking"
description: "This project aims to track the bounding box initialized at the first frame using Optical flow. The pixel flow is calculated on the features found using Harris Corner detector as well as Shi-Tomashi detector, and are regenerated whenever the tracker loses features. The are tracked using Lucas-Kanade Tracking algorithm and transformations are applied on the bounding box depending on the flow of the features."
