title: "Auto-Mapper"
description: "The aim of Auto-Mapper is to plan the paths for multi-agent given a prior of an environment like a blueprint. The project skeletonizes the blueprint, finds the nodes to be visited to map the area well. It then generates the waypoints to be visited by each of the agents using Ant Colony Optimization-routing algorithm to solve the multi-agent travelling salesman problem. The pipeline then uses FMT* algorithm as a global planner, and a hierarchical controller for local planning and control. The hierarchical controller has a set of precomputed paths and the path maximizing an objective is chosen and tracked using MPC controller."
