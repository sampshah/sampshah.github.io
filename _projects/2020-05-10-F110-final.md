title: "Racing Strategy: Planning and Control approaches"
description: "This was a course project where we came up with racing and planning strategies to beat opponents. We tried to solve various aspects of developing an end-to-end racing strategy. The first task being raceline optimization to find an optimal path to follow. We then extend to local planning by selecting a path which is dynamically feasible, and at the same time collision free, to track the globally optimal path and finally use Model Predictive Control for this reference tracking. We also implement lane switching strategy to promote overtaking maneuvers. The project was successful in racing while driving at the speed of 4.5 m/s and tackling various scenarios arising in head-to-head race situations."
