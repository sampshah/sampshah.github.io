title: "Design of compliant manipulator for micro-manipulation"
description: "The 4 PPR parallel manipulator with nano- manipulation capability was modeled using SolidWorks and its kinematic, inverse kinematic and dynamic analysis were done under the able guidance of Dr. Prasanna Gandhi and Dr. Yogesh Singh. The manipulator was flexure based to exploit the benefits of compliance for nano-manipulation, and U-base design was developed for its workspace superiority. The dynamic analysis was verified by the ANSYS simulation. The project work was presented at ICAME 2018 and published."
