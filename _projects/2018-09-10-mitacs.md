title: "Development of Underactuated Robotic Gripper"
description: "Awarded internship by Mitacs for design, development, and control of an underactuated multi-finger adaptive gripper at the Human-Robot Interaction laboratory under the guidance of Dr. Mehrdad Kermani. The hand with abduction-adduction capability had the majority of parts produced by 3D printing followed by fine machining. Libraries were developed for digital servo motors which were connected in a daisy chain topology communicating via RS485 protocol and actuated by STM32F4 ARM cortex-based micro-controller programmed with RTOS for the precise control of the fingers. Following that, contact point detection was performed for select objects for form closure grasp."
