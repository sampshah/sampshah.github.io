title: "American sign language to Speech CONverter (ASCON)"
description: "Designed a standalone Sign Language to Speech converter for speech impaired community. ASCON translated the hand gestures from the ASL to speech output. The glove had embedded flex sensors to sense the amount of bend in the fingers and was equipped with a 9-axis IMU sensor which had accelerometer and gyroscope used to provide the data about the motion of the hand, Kalman filter was implemented. The features were extracted from the data and used for training of the Artificial Neural Network and classification of the gestures to give the speech output with about 93% accuracy."
